# Java-Word-Counter

This program counts all the words of a text file and writes the word count to a new file specified by the user. 

The program takes as the name (along with the path) of a text file as command line argument. Then the program counts all the words. In addition, it places each word on a new line. Then it writes all the words (on a new line) and the word count to a new text file with the name specified by the user. This new text file will be in the same directory as the old text file.
